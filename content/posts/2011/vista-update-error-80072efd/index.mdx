Could not update Vista SP1 due to 0x80072EFD error, so I started out by manually updating to SP2. No success. This was driving me absolutely insane until I actually read the `C:\windows\windowsupdate.log` file.

First, try resetting the HTTP proxy through an elevated command prompt with the following command:

```
netsh winhttp show proxy
```

If you are still receiving this error, be sure you follow this KB:

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/836941

If this does not resolve the problem, try resetting Windows Update Components with the following Microsoft Fix It:

If this still does not work, be sure that WSUS GPO & registry settings are NOT in place!

First check GPO:

`Administrative Templates->Windows Components->Windows Update`, under the setting `Configure automatic updates.` If this is already set to `Not configured,` then check registry settings under:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate
```

For any WSUS keys. Deleting the WSUS keys I found in the registry fixed my issue.
