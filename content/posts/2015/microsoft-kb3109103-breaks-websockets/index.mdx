Recently my gulp live reload broke like so:

> ws://x.x.x.x:8080/LiveReload' failed: Error during WebSocket handshake: Unexpected response code: 200

Even though nothing changed, I noted patches had been installed over the weekend. After looking through which files were updated, I noticed that KB 3109103 patched `Wshrm.dll`. I was unable to find much useful information on this DLL, but after looking into the description it appeared to have a lot to do with sockets: Windows Sockets Helper DLL for PGM.
