I recently struggled with this one for work, after I made a change to IIS on our terminal server (Server 2008 Standard). I could not launch TS RemoteApps, as credentials were being consistently rejected, though correct. The only error I could find in the event log was along these lines:

> Log Name: System
> Source: LsaSrv
> Date: 10/27/2008 10:46:40 PM
> Event ID: 6037
> Task Category: None
> Level: Warning
> Keywords: Classic
> User: N/A
> Computer: Gateway
> Description:
> The program lsass.exe, with the assigned process ID 572, could not authenticate locally by using the target name TERMSERV/ts.xxxx.com. The target name used is not valid. A target name should refer to one of the local computer names, for example, the DNS host name.

This error may also contain address `HTTP/ts.xxxx.com`.

Thanks to Chad A. Gross on the http://www.vistax64.com forums, I was pointed at a blog with a solution: http://blogs.technet.com/sbs/archive/2009/05/07/event-2436-for-sharepoint-services-3-search.aspx.

Though the blog states a solution for a different problem, it worked just as well for me:

Click Start, click Run, type `regedit`, and then click OK.
In Registry Editor, locate and then click the following registry key:
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\MSV1_0`
Right-click `MSV1_0`, point to `New`, and then click `Multi-String Value`.
Type `BackConnectionHostNames`, and then press ENTER.
Right-click `BackConnectionHostNames`, and then click `Modify`.
In the `Value` data box, type the URL mentioned in the above warning event, and then click `OK`.
Quit Registry Editor, and then restart the IIS service.

For good measure, I restarted the server and bam, the error was gone.
