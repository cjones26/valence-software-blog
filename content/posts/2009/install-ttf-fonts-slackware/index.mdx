I was recently working on a project for my boss when I found I needed to install some new fonts for GIMP.

I had downloaded some free TTF's from http://www.1001freefonts.com/ & needed to install them.

Restarting X was a pain, so I found the following steps worked with only restarting GIMP:

1.) Move your fonts into the `~/.fonts` folder. Create it if it doesn't exist.
2.) Run command `makefontdir`
3.) Run command `makefontscale`
4.) Run command `fc-cache`
5.) Finally, command `xset fp rehash`
6.) Restart whatever application you're working with, be it GIMP, OpenOffice, or whatever.

Your font should now be listed!
