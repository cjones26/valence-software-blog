Ever get tired of digging through the registry `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall` and `HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall` keys searching for a product? Luckily, there's a much faster way to find the GUID, simply run the following command--in this case, we are searching for the Symantec uninstall string:

```
wmic product get | findstr Symantec
```

Though the formatting of the result is off, it's still quite easy to locate the GUID and proceed to uninstall the product like so:

```
msiexec /x {guid}
```
